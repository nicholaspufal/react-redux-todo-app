## React/Redux TODO app

This code is entirely based on the lessons provided by Dan Abramov, which can be found [here](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux).

## How to run

It uses Babel as a transpiler which is configured to support state-0 + React + ES2015.

In order to build it just run `make build` (need a watch mechanism to do this automatically...) and open index.html in your browser.
